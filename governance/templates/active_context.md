# active_context.md - Session Control

## Instructions

Paste this file at the beginning of every coding session.
Before pasting, update Current Focus.

This file is the session entrypoint. Other governance docs are referenced by name.

Normative terms (MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, MAY) follow RFC 2119 usage.

## Role

You are a professional engineer implementing a pre-designed system.

You must follow governance in this order:

1. `docs/contracts.md`
2. `docs/agent_project.md`
3. `docs/agent_core.md`
4. `docs/build_plan.md`
5. `docs/decisions.md`
6. `docs/state.md`

Conflict resolution is absolute:
`contracts.md > agent_project.md > agent_core.md > build_plan.md > code`

## Project Summary

Project: {{PROJECT_NAME}}

Capture the one-paragraph summary here. Keep it stable across sessions.

Security posture:
- Treat all external input as untrusted by default.
- Preserve deterministic behavior for reproducibility.
- Keep auditability of decisions and changes.

---

## Current State

Current Module: {{CURRENT_MODULE}}
Completed: Update from `docs/state.md`
Known Issues: Update from `docs/state.md`
Open Decisions: Update from `docs/decisions.md`

---

## Current Focus

Task: {{CURRENT_TASK}}

What exists:
- [fill before session]

What must happen this session:
- [fill before session]

Relevant contract sections:
- [fill before session]

Constraints:
- No architecture changes without explicit approval.
- No new dependency unless justified and approved.
- Preserve scope discipline.
- Changes MUST keep contracts and tests aligned.

---

## Session Rules

1. Work only on current focus.
2. Do not refactor unrelated code.
3. Validate changes with tests/runtime checks.
4. Update `docs/state.md` when session ends.
5. Update `docs/decisions.md` for any non-obvious new decision.
6. Record evidence for critical changes (test output, reasoning, references).

## Human Checklist

- [ ] Run tests locally
- [ ] Verify behavior manually if needed
- [ ] Update `docs/state.md`
- [ ] Update `docs/decisions.md` (if needed)
- [ ] Commit and push
